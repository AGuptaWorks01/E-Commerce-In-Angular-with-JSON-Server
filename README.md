# E-commerce Project Overview
This project is an e-commerce platform that allows sellers to add, manage, and list their products, while users can browse, add items to their cart, and place orders. The project utilizes JSON Server for backend functionality, simulating a database with mock data.

Key Features:
Seller Functionality:

Sellers can add products to the platform with details such as name, price, description, and images.
Sellers can manage their product listings, including the ability to update or remove products.
Sellers have an admin page where they can manage their products and oversee the marketplace.
User Functionality:

Users can view available products and browse through different categories or listings.
Users can add products to their shopping cart and review their selections.
Users can remove products from the cart if needed.
The system also includes a logout functionality to securely end user sessions.
Order Page:

Once the user is ready, they can view an order page where they can proceed to finalize their purchase.
The order page displays the cart contents and the total amount for checkout.
JSON Server API:

The application leverages JSON Server to simulate a RESTful backend, enabling CRUD operations for products, users, and orders.
All data (such as product details, user cart, and orders) is handled through JSON-based API calls.
Tech Stack:
Frontend: [HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React or another framework/library used for UI]
Backend: JSON Server (Mock Database)
Authentication: Session management for user login/logout
Database: JSON file (simulated using JSON Server)
This project aims to provide a simple yet functional prototype of an e-commerce platform with basic features such as product management, user interaction, and order processing.
